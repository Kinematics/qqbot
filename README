This is the code which runs the qqbot vote and dice script in
#questionablequesting.

Dice are in dicebot.py, vote counting is in countbot.py. Both can theoretically
function under multiple bot frameworks, but the recommended use is as a Willie
module. default.cfg is a config file to make Willie use said modules. You should
symlink the scripts into willie's module directory.

They run in a Linux environment under Python 3. Any attempt to make them work
somewhere else is the responsibility of the attempter.

countbot is dependent on forum_archive, my forum interaction module. That's
available under my Github. It has some dependencies itself. Look there.
